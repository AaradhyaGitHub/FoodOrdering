Start by sketching the project out and plan it out 

We will have a lots of meals pictures which we will need to fetch from backend 

We have a basic header with the cart button which opens a modal which gives us a summary of our order 

We have a checkout feature which is a form 

Here is the general outline plan: 
1. Add the Header Component 
2. Add meals-related components  
3. Add the logic to fetch meals from a backend 
4. Add cart logic -> CRUD  
5. Add Checkout page logic 

Getting started: 
Make a component folder under src 
Make a Header.jsx file 
Header returns the HTML header element with some other generic header elements inside it like nav 
Then we import that on App and display our very first component
